# Speech-to-Text-Recognition-Arabic-
In this task I used [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API)<br />
I built a website that takes the user input, then the input will be used by the API, and then the API will return the result in Arabic.<br />
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for developing, and [Surge](https://surge.sh/) for hosting the website.
